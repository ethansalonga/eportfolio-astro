About one week ago I decided that I wanted to become a technical writer and make a career out of it. This would be the second time in my life I'm making a career transition, and it feels a bit conflicting at 26 years old.  
<br>
One part of me believes I should be sticking to one career at this age, gaining valuable experience and climbing up the corporate ladder. The other part of me is constantly reminding myself that life is short, and that I should seize the opportunity to take risks and explore what I'm truly passionate about while I'm young.

## Journey to Becoming a Technical Writer
<br>
I graduated from the Watson College of Engineering & Applied Science in Binghamton University in 2020 with a bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering. It was a weird and difficult time not just for myself, but for the entire world. We all had to overcome and adapt to challenges we had never faced before. I never ended up walking to receive my diploma that year, but I earned that degree all the same.  
<br>
<br>
During my time in the BME program, I had the opportunity to learn many useful skills: (Note my use of an unordered list instead of an embedded list. I learned that one from the Google Technical Writing course. Master technical writer here I come.)<br><br>

- Core engineering principles
- Engineering design and processes
- Analytical problem-solving
- Researching and writing papers
<br>
<br>
It was all pretty interesting stuff and the field of biomedical engineering seemed cool, but after graduating and working in the field for a year as an equipment technician, I quickly realized it wasn't a career I was particularly passionate about.
<br>
<br>
Fast forward to October 2022 when I decided to transition my career into software development, specifically the web development space as a front-end engineer. After taking an online course and spending pretty much every waking hour outside my full-time job coding and applying for roles, I was lucky enough to receive a job offer after just 10 weeks. I still remember the glorious rush of success and accomplishment I felt that night.
<br>
<br>
And so, for the past 3 years I've worked as a web developer for an international telehealth startup and have thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I've learned a great deal about tech, programming, and documentation, all subjects I think will carry over nicely to what will hopefully be my new career. While I still find web development fun and fascinating, once again, I find myself at a crossroads. Is this really what I want to do for the rest of my life?<br><br>

## It Was Always Writing
<br>
I never thought of myself as a writer until my second year of high school, when my English teacher really opened the door for me into this brand new world. After that I learned to love writing. I loved reading and writing creative fiction, researching and writing long papers, and learning about some of the greatest writers in history. 
<br>
<br>
In most of my teams in college I volunteered to handle the heavy writing work and was happy to do so. I even made a small amount of money writing other kids' papers for them. A bit morally ambiguous I admit, but weren't we all stupid kids once? 
<br>
<br>
After graduating I didn't do much more writing, letting my passion for it fall to the wayside in favor of a more engineering-focused career path. Thankfully I've been giving myself the opportunity to write more lately and really explore whether technical writing is the right path for me.
<br>
<br>
I'm hoping it is.
